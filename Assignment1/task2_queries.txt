a) Count high speeds: Find the number of speeds > 100 in the data set.
     
      In the FREEWAY_LOOPDATA table,
            for all rows{
                  if SPEED > 100
                  increment counter
            return counter
         }
b) Volume: Find the total volume for the station "Foster NB" for Sept 21, 2011.
     
      In the FREEWAY_STATIONS table,
            scan LOCATION_TEXT column for "Foster NB"
                  FS_ID = Station_ID
      In the FREEWAY_DETECTORS table,
            for all rows where STATION_ID == FS_ID{
                  FD_ID = DETECTOR_ID
                  In the FREEWAY_LOOPDATA table:
                        for all rows where DETECTOR_ID = FD_ID{
                              if STARTTIME includes 9/21/2011
                                    TOTAL_VOLUME = TOTAL_VOLUME + VOLUME
                         }
            }
            
c) Peak Period Travel Times: Find the average travel time for 7-9AM and 4-6PM 
   on September 22, 20011 for station Foster NB. Report travel time in seconds.
   You should have one average travvel time for 7-9AM and one average travel 
   time for 4-6PM.
     In the FREEWAY_STATIONS table,
          scan LOCATION_TEXT for "Foster NB"
               STATION_ID_KEY = FREEWAY_STATIONS.STATION_ID
               LENGTH = FREEWAY_STATIONS.LENGTH
               
d) Route Finding: Find a route from Johnson Creek to Columbia Blvd on I-205 NB
   using the upstream and downstream fields.
     In the FREEWAY_STATIONS table,
          next_station_id = downstream where locationtext == "Johnson Cr NB"
          while (locationtext != "Columbia to I-205 NB" where stationid == next_station_id){
               next_station_id = downstream
          }

e) Update: Update stationid 1140 to have a length of 2.3.
     In the FREEWAY_STATIONS table
          set (1140, 2.3)
